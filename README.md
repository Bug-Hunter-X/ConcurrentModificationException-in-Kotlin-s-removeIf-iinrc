This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Kotlin involving the `removeIf` function on collections.  The `removeIf` function iterates and removes elements from a collection based on a predicate. This is generally safe for `MutableList`. However, when used with `MutableMap` or `MutableSet`, it may throw a `ConcurrentModificationException` if the iterator's underlying collection is modified during iteration. The example showcases this behavior and provides a solution.
